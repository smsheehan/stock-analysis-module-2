# Stock Analysis - Module 2 Challenge

## Overview of Project
Module 2 was an introduction to visual basic for applications (vba) and was focused on manipulation of the 2017 and 2018 stock information from 12 different environmentally companies.  These "green stocks" needed to be analyzed to help our fictional friend "Steve" who was interested in providing his parents with an analysis to help them make investment decisions.  Throughout the module, in the excel developer environment, we built vba code that enabled the end user to select a year and then have the Total Daily Volume and Rate of Return for the year for each stock calculated and presented in a conditional formatted table.  Additionaly we learned to incorporate a run timer so we could see how long it took our code to execute.  The purpose of this challenge was for us to refactor the code to make it more efficient in how it processes data and as a result run the process more quicly than the original code.

## Results

The refactored code delivered the same spreadsheet results as the original code.

The refactored code executed the analysis more quickly than the original.
